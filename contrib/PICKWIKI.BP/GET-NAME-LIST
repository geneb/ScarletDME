This is a program to build a select list (and list names to screen ). It uses a file called MEMBERS and works with fields LAST.NAME and FIRST.NAME. New fields LASTX and FIRSTX were created as "I" descriptors. <2> SOUNDEX(FIELD(@RECORD<3>,' ',1)) for last name process. I indexed on LASTX and FIRSTX for file MEMBERS. MEMBERS has 2.6 million records and took 135 seconds to select specific names. We are using an "L" class machine running with 3 CPUs and EMC box for drives. With specific first and last spelled like name sounds usually turns up the name among others in just a fraction of a second. If you use a "*" then it may get slower to "sort" the select list into the sorted order for display.
